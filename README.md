# Block Visibility – Add-on Example

[Block Visibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/) allows you to dynamically control which blocks are visible on your WordPress website and who can see them, which includes the ability to schedule blocks.

This example add-on plugin for Block Visibility illustrates how to extend core functionality with additional visibility controls. The plugin adds an "Example Control" that allows you to toggle the visibility of any block. Use this example as the foundation for your own more sophisticated visibility controls.
